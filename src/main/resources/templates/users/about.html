                            The journey of Corpseed started with a simple thought: why do companies fail even after
                            having a great idea, good execution plan, and cash flow. Why investors are worried about
                            investing in Indian startups and mid-sized businesses. Few of the key challenges are
                            changing regulatory framework, evolving environment and social governance, acquiring
                            government permissions and clearances and compliant with internal audits etc. It seems like
                            a pretty simple concept — you comply with the rules and survive, but it’s not an easy
                            journey for a company to know the right set of legal and regulatory requirements. To manage
                            these hurdles we came up with a concept of listing compliance requirements for products and
                            services at one place with an AI driven model, wherein management and other stakeholders can
                            have direct access to all compliance activities within their organization to fill the gaps?
